          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Our well–loved Canal is a costly and inefficient means of delivering irrigation water; on average, 60 to 80 percent of the water diverted into the Canal from the South Platte River, seeps into the ground or evaporates. Today, the historic Canal faces new challenges. Water scarcity and unprecedented growth of our region, combined with the inefficiency of the Canal as a means of delivering water to customers, has precipitated the need to reassess the use and future role of the Canal. </p>
          <img src="img\canalStormwater.JPG" alt="Image with stormwater in the canal">
          <p>To reassess the Canal’s future, the Conservancy–along with its partners Denver Water, Urban Drainage and Flood Control District (UDFCD), and participating jurisdictions–have extensively studied the possibility of repurposing the historic irrigation ditch to provide multi layered benefits for our communities.</p>
          <p>Through the efforts of the Conservancy and the 2018 High Line Canal Stormwater and Operations Master Plan, the Conservancy and its partners will plan for and seize opportunities to transition the Canal into an inspiring model of stormwater management.</p>
          <p>The Stormwater Management tools assess the hydraulic functioning of the Canal and help identify the necessary improvements for safe stormwater management. Additionally, the tools help to guide stormwater-related design improvements to achieve the desired character of the Canal.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Findings from High Line Canal Stormwater and Operations Master Plan </h2>
          <p>In 2018, UDFCD completed the High Line Canal Stormwater and Operations Master Plan, which examined the operational and flood control considerations and the needed improvements to use the Canal for water quality and flood control purposes with existing stormwater discharges. Because the Canal cuts across many watersheds today, a significant amount of stormwater already inadvertently makes its way into the Canal. The study explores formalizing the management of the existing stormwater and the potential of directing additional stormwater to the Canal while maintaining the corridor as a recreational asset and thriving natural environment.</p>
          <p>Findings from the Master Plan show that implementation of stormwater systems can: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Improve the quality of water currently discharged from the Canal.</li>
            <li>Reduce the current flood risks with recommended stormwater improvements.</li>
            <li>Allow the Canal to accept additional stormwater for water quality treatment and movement of stormwater.</li>
            <li>Facilitate coordination of stormwater goals across multiple jurisdictions.</li>
            <li>Provide opportunities to implement sustainable design practices for multiple benefits. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Master Plan highlights areas of concern and recommends stormwater modifications to the Canal to protect people and property during 100-year storm events.</p>
          <p>Some of the modifications include: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adding constructed overflows where extra water can discharge into another natural waterway.</li>
            <li>Adjusting the height of embankments to direct flows to certain areas.</li>
            <li>Introducing over 100 water quality berms to slow down water and increase infiltration into the soil.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Through this work, UDFCD developed a hydraulic model to analyze the capacity of the Canal, both when it is dry and while it is being utilized to deliver irrigation water. Alternatives were developed that maximize water infiltration and water quality treatment as well as ones that minimize flooding. The plan of improvements that was developed provides one approach for the entire Canal that allows for long range planning of costs and benefits. This includes the addition of water quality berms or small weirs in the Canal, together with formalized spillways to direct excess water to other waterways.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>How the tool is used</h2>
          <p>UDFCD’s hydraulic model will serve as the tool to assess the necessary improvements for stormwater implementation and management. This model serves as the operational baseline and framework that jurisdictions will use to plan for future stormwater projects along the Canal. Each proposed project, or improvement, needs to be evaluated individually and holistically along the Canal to determine its feasibility before implementation. UDFCD will maintain the hydraulic model and update it based on new projects and future Canal modifications.</p>

          <h2>Benefits of Stormwater</h2>
          <article class="">
            <h3>What Is Stormwater Runoff? </h3>
            <p>Stormwater runoff is rainwater or snowmelt that runs off a surface–such as driveways, parking lots or rooftops–and flows into storm drains and eventually into our waterways. </p>
            <p>Stormwater either infiltrates the ground through permeable natural surfaces (such as soil or grass), or it runs off hard surfaces (such as driveways, sidewalks, and streets) and escapes natural cleansing by plants and soil. If stormwater hits wetlands, forests, and grasslands, these natural resources temporarily hold excess water in place, filtering out sediment and pollutants before they reach waterways.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="">
            <h3>Why Is It Important to Manage Stormwater?</h3>
            <p>Stormwater runoff from urban areas is a significant cause of environmental degradation of our waterways. As stormwater drains toward waterways, it can pick up contaminants from trash, pet waste, cars, pesticides or other sources along the way. Without proper management, this polluted runoff may cause harmful effects on water supplies, recreation areas, fisheries, and wildlife. In addition, as the Denver metro area continues to develop with more impervious surfaces, stormwater runoff may increase, leading to a higher chance of flooding and worsened water quality.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="">
            <h3>What Is Green Infrastructure?</h3>
            <p>A sustainable way to manage stormwater is through green infrastructure. Green infrastructure helps to minimize unmanaged stormwater runoff going into our natural waterways. It can be a cost–effective, resilient approach to managing wet-weather impacts by mimicking the natural environment to slow down stormwater runoff and improve water quality. Green infrastructure for stormwater systems can work in many forms, including rain gardens, bioswales or bioretention cells, and detention ponds.</p>

          <h2>What are the potential benefits of green infrastructure?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduces improperly managed stormwater runoff, and therefore:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Decreases water treatment needs</li>
                <li>Improves water quality</li>
                <li>Supplements traditional and more expensive gray infrastructure</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Increases groundwater recharge </li>
            <li>Reduces salt contamination </li>
            <li>Reduces energy use </li>
            <li>Improves air quality </li>
            <li>Improves wildlife and natural habitat </li>
            <li>Improves aesthetics </li>
            <li>Increases recreational opportunities </li>
            <li>Reduces noise pollution</li>
            <li>Improves community cohesion</li>

          <h2>Stormwater Implementation </h2>
          <p>Once a stormwater improvement program is determined to be feasible based on the hydraulic functioning of the segment, the Design Guidelines offer guidance for stormwater improvements.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the Conservancy initiated the Stormwater Transformation and Enhancement Program (STEP) to plan for and implement a transformation of the Canal into an inspiring model of stormwater management. Specifically, the overarching goals of STEP are to: (1) identify, plan, and implement stormwater management projects in the Canal that responsibly transform it into a stormwater management system; and (2) develop a collaborative management, maintenance, financial, and operational model to enhance the multiple benefits the Canal can provide. </p>
