            <h2>Introductions</h2>
            <p>The High Line Canal is an experience like no other in the Denver region. Historically engineered for the conveyance of irrigation water and now used primarily for recreation, its uniqueness as a greenway stems from its original function as a utility. It does not conform to the traditions of city grids or natural water bodies. Rather, it winds its way with the region’s topography in a completely unexpected way–revealing to its users an unfolding sequence of views, encounters, and experiences that feel both interwoven within and a world apart from its urban context.
            </p>
            <p>The Plan serves as a pathway forward to revitalize and transition the Canal as a regional greenway while improving the health of the ecosystem. The Plan illuminates both the opportunities and challenges that accompany the historic Canal system, while laying out inspiring and practical guidance for improvements that honor and enhance its unique attributes. The recommendations are customized to respect the character of the varied communities along the way and offer improvements to areas that are currently underserved by or in high need of public open space.

            <h2>Canal-Wide Objectives</h2>
            <p>The Canal-Wide Objectives summarize the holistic and ambitious ideas that underpin all of the Plan’s recommendations. They were developed by looking carefully at the findings from the existing-conditions report, listening intently to community and stakeholder feedback, and understanding the technical challenges at hand for this complex system. These represent our highest aspirations for the future of the resource and a series of strategies to realize them.

                  <h4>Health, Safety & Experience</h4>
                  <p>The High Line Canal’s form and character emerged from its need to convey water and was never planned as a place for people. As such, the Canal, moving through the urban grid, produced unusual relationships and feels lacking in amenities. The Plan promotes strategies to improve the human experience through intentional design and maintenance, supporting the physical, mental, and social well–being of its users.</p>

                  <h4>Environmental Health</h4>
                  <p>The High Line Canal serves as a natural escape for hundreds of thousands of people each year and is an important 71-mile ecological corridor connecting the foothills to the plains, playing an important role in supporting biodiversity for the region’s wildlife and vegetation. The Plan promotes strengthening the environmental health of the Canal and encouraging sustainable interaction with nature to enable the Canal to continue as a thriving natural corridor, increasing resilience and the health of our region.</p>

                  <h4>Honor & Repurpose</h4>
                  <p>The High Line Canal was hand dug in the 1880s as a 71-mile irrigation utility, promising a better future to our region’s original settlers. Since then, the corridor has evolved and offers new ways to bring that promise of a bright future to its surrounding communities. The Plan promotes the Canal as a place that captures the region’s pride by honoring its historical identity and creating new life for the legacy as a model of green infrastructure. Through stormwater management, the repurposed Canal will provide multiple benefits, including ecological, physical, and social health.</p>

                  <h4>Accessiblity & Connectivity</h4>
                  <p>The High Line Canal threads its way through the varied communities of the region, but not all users enjoy equal access to a quality green space and outdoor activities. The Plan promotes a safe and continuous 71-mile greenway for all people and communities, serving to knit together the various communities and nature by providing improved access and connectivity.</p>

These six tools are the essential elements of the Plan, and provide guidance for organizations, jurisdictions, and the Conservancy to collectively evolve the Canal.
