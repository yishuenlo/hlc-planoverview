            <h2>Process + Timeline</h2>
            <p>Building upon the Community Vision Plan, a collaborative process to develop The Plan for the High Line Canal began in the fall of 2017 and advanced parallel to the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District High Line Canal Stormwater Master Plan. The recommendations and agreements from these plans will serve as the basis for future management and governance models.</p>
            <img src="" alt="timeline image">
            <p>The Plan established a broad base of support and engaged constituents, which expanded during the planning process. To accomplish this, the High Line Canal Conservancy continued to work closely with Denver Water, the jurisdictions, and the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District to ground the ideas from the Community Vision Plan to physical locations along the Canal.</p>
            <p>The planning team organized the community outreach and engagement efforts around two sets of open houses and smaller focus group meetings to discuss community specific needs and desires. Early in the process, additional engagement was focused on neighborhoods in Aurora, Four Square Mile, and northeast Denver, as well as youth and other hard-to-reach communities.</p>

              <h3>Open Houses</h3>
              <p>Two phases of community open houses were held at key points in the planning process. At each phase, two open houses were held, one in the south and one in the north, with identical materials presented at each meeting so that stakeholders and community members could select the day that worked best for their schedule. Each open house provided background information but also served as a key point for those attending to provide input. </p>

              <h3>Stakeholder Meetings and Focus Groups</h3>
              <p>A number of community and neighborhood–scaled meetings were held to solicit specific feedback from communities and jurisdictions along the Canal. Early in 2018, the planning team attended neighborhood meetings, youth group gatherings, school events, and senior gatherings to share the findings from the existing conditions and listen to the desires of each group. </p>
              <p>In late summer/early fall of 2018, six focus group meetings were held based roughly on jurisdictional and larger neighborhood boundaries. The intent of these meetings was to review the specific plan recommendations and receive additional feedback on other recommendations. These meetings further informed the specific recommendations within the Character Zone maps, shown in the next section of the Plan. </p>

              <h3>Health and Education Program Development</h3>
              <p>The Conservancy performed additional outreach in diverse communities along the Canal in Aurora and Denver as part of a grant from the Colorado Health Foundation. Conservancy staff met with community organizations and local residents to identify enhancements and programs that will increase use of the Canal and improve community health. Priorities for physical enhancements centered on improved access and awareness, removing barriers that prevent residents from using the Canal as a source of recreation and exploration. Programs such as youth education, community walks and bicycle outings will also be important tools to build awareness and increase use of the Canal in these communities, and will complement the physical improvements.</p>

              <h3>Environmental Education</h3>
              <p>The High Line Canal has the potential to be an outdoor classroom, where youth and their families can connect with nature and learn about Colorado’s natural environment. The Conservancy partnered with local community nonprofit Environmental Learning for Kids (ELK) to pilot environmental education programs on the Canal with great success. ELK ran an after–school program with students at South Middle School, located on the Canal in Aurora. ELK also led a series of youth and families walks, connecting residents of Aurora and Denver to a variety of Canal segments. During these outings, the Conservancy solicited feedback from participants about enhancements and programs that will remove barriers to spontaneous use of the Canal in these communities.</p>

              <h3>Walk the Canal</h3>
              <p>The Conservancy has partnered with Walk2Connect to lead a series of walks covering all 71 miles of the High Line Canal. These walks have grown a passionate community of Canal supporters and exposed new users to all five of the Canal’s Character Zones. Conservancy staff participated in many of these walks, soliciting input both inperson and through surveys about ways the Canal could be enhanced. Walk2Connect also developed community–based walking leaders to lead walks on the Canal in their neighborhoods.</p>

            <h2>Community Input Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Throughout the process, a number of key takeaways emerged. These takeaways have helped shape the recommendations and prioritization within the Plan.</p>
            <article class="stormwater">
              <h3>Stormwater and Landscape</h3>
              <p>The public continually expressed a strong desire to have stormwater directed to the Canal to support the corridor’s environmental health. Additionally, the public questioned how quickly stormwater improvements can take place so that the plants and trees receive water. </p>
